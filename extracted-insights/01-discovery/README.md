This folder contains the structured outputs extracted from raw artifacts in the parent `raw-artifacts/` folder.

## Contents

## Purpose

This folder is generated by Copilot when you invoke the discovery phase. Copilot reads all files in `../raw-artifacts/` and outputs structured insights here.

## Workflow

2. Invoke: `/process-discovery`
3. Review outputs in this folder
4. Iterate with: `/refine-discovery`
