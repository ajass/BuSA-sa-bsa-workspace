# Extracted Insights - 02 Architecture

This folder contains the architecture artifacts generated from the discovery phase.

## Contents

- [solution-overview.md](./solution-overview.md) - High-level solution summary
- [c4-context.puml](./c4-context.puml) - C4 Context diagram (Mermaid)
- [c4-container.puml](./c4-container.puml) - C4 Container diagram (Mermaid)
- [c4-component.puml](./c4-component.puml) - C4 Component diagram (Mermaid)
- [integration-options.md](./integration-options.md) - Integration patterns evaluated
- [data-ownership.md](./data-ownership.md) - Data domain mapping
- [architecture-decisions.md](./architecture-decisions.md) - ADRs

## Purpose

This folder is generated by Copilot when you invoke the architecture phase. Copilot reads files in `01-discovery/` and `../raw-artifacts/` to produce architecture artifacts.

## Workflow

1. Complete discovery phase (01-discovery/)
2. Invoke: `/process-architecture`
3. Review outputs in this folder
4. Iterate with: `/refine-architecture`
